W3School:
--> C++ is a popular langauge and use for computer program and most for developing the games.
--> C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup.
--> C++ is the extension of language C both are almost same syntex.
--> first code of cpp : ``` #include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main () {
    cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
    return 0;
